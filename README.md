# scylla-db-proxy
### An Open Source, Rust-based ScyllaDB proxy

**scylla-db-proxy** allows you to execute queries and statements with just an HTTP call. 
It adds a layer of abstraction between the ScyllaDB API and the user, thus helping getting rid of all the work that needs to be done before being able to use the ScyllaDB API. 

All of this without - of course - losing the speed of Scylla, thanks to Rust.
